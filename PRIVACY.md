# Privacy Policy for PreviewTube

**Last Updated:** October 2025

## Overview

PreviewTube is a browser extension designed to enhance your YouTube browsing experience by displaying video transcripts as previews. This extension is built with privacy as a core principle and collects absolutely no personal information.

## Data Collection

**We collect NO data whatsoever.** This extension:

- ✅ Does not collect any personal information
- ✅ Does not track your browsing habits
- ✅ Does not store any data on external servers
- ✅ Does not send any information to third parties
- ✅ Does not use analytics or tracking services
- ✅ Does not require user accounts or registration

## How the Extension Works

PreviewTube operates entirely locally on your device:

1. **Local Operation Only**: The extension runs entirely within your browser and only modifies the display of YouTube pages you visit
2. **No External Communication**: The extension does not communicate with any external servers or services
3. **Uses YouTube's Own APIs**: The extension only intercepts and displays data that YouTube already provides through its own transcript API
4. **No Data Storage**: No transcripts, video information, or user data is stored anywhere

## Permissions Explained

The extension requires minimal permissions:

- **`scripting`**: Required to inject the transcript display functionality into YouTube pages
- **`https://www.youtube.com/*`**: Required to access YouTube pages where the extension operates

These permissions are used solely for the extension's core functionality and do not enable any data collection or external communication.

## Third-Party Services

This extension does not integrate with any third-party services, analytics platforms, or external APIs (except for YouTube's own transcript API, which is accessed directly by your browser).

## Data Security

Since no data is collected, there is no data to secure. Your privacy is protected by design.

## Updates to This Policy

If this privacy policy is updated, the changes will be reflected in this document. The extension's core privacy principles will remain unchanged.

## Contact

If you have any questions about this privacy policy or the extension's privacy practices, please refer to the project repository or documentation.

## Summary

PreviewTube is a completely private extension that enhances your YouTube experience without compromising your privacy in any way. It operates locally, collects no data, and maintains your privacy by design.
